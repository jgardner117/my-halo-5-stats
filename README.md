# My Halo 5 Stats

This page calls an AWS Lambda Python (found [here](https://github.com/jgardner117/my-halo-5-stats-lambda-function)) function to access 343's Halo 5 Game Data API and display the results from the queries using Materialize and DataTables to display the information. I'm a gamer & data nerd and I have a larger personal application that ties together all of my gaming stats, and thought this would be a great addition (and a great portfolio piece as well). A simple, lightweight Materialize based website.
